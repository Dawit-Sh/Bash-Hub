To add a script to your crontab so it runs every 20 minutes, you need to edit your crontab file. You can do this by running the following command:

crontab -e

This will open your crontab file in your default text editor. The crontab file is a text file that contains a list of commands that you want to run at regular intervals.

To add a script to run every 20 minutes, you need to add the following line to your crontab file:

*/20 * * * * /path/to/script.sh

The first five fields in the crontab line specify the following:

    Minute (0-59)
    Hour (0-23)
    Day of the month (1-31)
    Month (1-12)
    Day of the week (0-7, where 0 is Sunday and 7 is Saturday)

The asterisk (*) in the minute field means that the script will run every minute.

The path to the script is the full path to the script file.

Once you have added the line to your crontab file, save and close the file. The script will now run every 20 minutes.

Here is an example of a crontab line that would run a script called battery_level.sh every 20 minutes:

*/20 * * * * /home/user/battery_level.sh

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
