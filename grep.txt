 1)    Search any line that contains the word in filename on Linux:
    # grep 'word' filename
  
2)   Perform a case-insensitive search for the word ‘bar’ in Linux and Unix:
    # grep -i 'bar' file1
   
3)  Look for all files in the current directory and in all of its subdirectories in Linux for the word ‘httpd’:
    # grep -R 'httpd' .
   
4)  Search and display the total number of times that the string ‘nixcraft’ appears in a file named frontpage.md:
   # grep -c 'linux' frontpage.md

5) search recursively i.e. read all files under each directory for a string 
    # grep -r "search" /etc/
    # grep -R "search" /etc/

6) searh for two different words 
    # grep -E -w 'word1|word2' /path/to/file

7) force grep to ignore case distinctions in patterns and data. For example, when I search for ‘bar’, match ‘BAR’, ‘Bar’, ‘BaR’ and so on:
    # grep -i 'bar' /path/to/file

8) print all line that do not contain the word bar
    # grep -v bar /path/to/file

9) see the lines before your matches Try passing the -B to the grep:
    # grep -B NUM "word" file
    # grep -B 3 "foo" file1

10) display the lines after your matches by passing the -A to the grep:
    # grep -A NUM "string" /path/to/file 
    # grep -A 4 "dropped" /var/log/ufw.log

11) Use the -l option to list file name whose contents mention main()
    # grep -l 'main' *.c
